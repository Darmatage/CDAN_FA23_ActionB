"**The Dark Farm**" is a single player game designed by students of the Fall 2023 Game Design class at Massachusetts College of Art and Design.
The designers are Dee McKenna, Ava Matt, Adam Gaal, and Rob Menino. They created the game in Unity and Adobe Photoshop in collaboration with their teacher, Jason Wiser, and with music by Sebastien Hollich.

The game was pitched as a "**Horror Tower-Defense Farming Game**". 
It features day phases for gathering resources and crafting defenses, and night phases for warding off encroaching monsters.
